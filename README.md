## Focus on writing landing page content, not CSS

### types of boxes

always use `section` elements to define boxes

Use class `.media` when wanting to include an image, animation, or video on the page
* Contains an `img`, `svg`, or `video` element
* Will maintain the media's aspect ratio (5:4) no matter what screen size the user is using (mobile / tablet / desktop)

Use class `.content` when wanting to include headings, text, or form controls on the page
* Contains `h1-h6`, `p`, `div`, `form`, `input`, `button`, `a`
* Will maintain the box's aspect ratio (5:4) on desktop devices only &mdash; on smaller screen sizes (e.g. tablet, mobile) the amount of content will determine the box's size

### what is a box

a box is a section of content (text or media) that can appear next to other sections of content

it's always responsive by default and maintains its aspect ratio where it makes sense (esp. `.media` boxes)

the goal of a box is that you define how it looks on one screen size (e.g. desktop) and it automatically will adapt to look good on every other screen size (e.g. tablet & mobile)

### floating labels with inputs

```html
  <div class="floating-label-container">
    <input id="email" type="email" name="email" placeholder="Enter your email address">
    <label for="email">Enter your email address</label>
  </div>
```

### how to make SVGs responsive

1. make a vector image with 5:4 width to height ratio
2. export an SVG with `viewBox` attribute
3. put the SVG image in a `.media` box

### known issues

* Images inside `.media` boxes sometimes don't expand to fill the entire box â€” there's a slight gap (example)
